<h1> Chapter 8 Prep</h1>

    The data discussed in Cairo's Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 are quite different from each other in the aspect that Chapter 8 builds onto what is established in Chapter 7. In Chapter 7, concepts like mean, median, and mode (measures of central tendency) are established. These concepts are the basis of data visualization. In Chapter 8, concepts like moving average, logarhythmic transformations, and zero-based indexes build onto the data concepts discussed in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 discusses how to reval changes in data visualizations, while Chapter 7 simply describes the elements that make a good data visualization. The ability to reveal change in a data visualization allows new perspectives about the data to be conceived. These new perspectives reveal things about a data set that might not be previously recongnized without applying concepts that change the makeup of the data visualization. All in all, Chapter 8 builds upon the topics discussed in Chapter 7 and goes into depth on how to reveal changes within a data set, whereas Chapter 7 lays out the basics of creating a good data visualization.

    3 visualization techniques that seem quite important in revealing change are the zero-based index, the logarhythmic transformation, and the moving average. The zero-based index is an index that starts counting from zero rather than from the usual starting point of one. This allows an easier representation of the first element of a data set by counting the elements starting withzero. This also makes it so the computer can ignore the first element (labeled the 0th element in this type of index) if needed. One disadvantage to this type of index is that it can get confusing having to remember that the first element is technically labeled as element 0. This can make counting elements sometimes misleading because you forget about the 0th element being the beginning of the data set. Another concept that helps reveal change is the logarhythmic transformation, which takes data and sets it to a specific base number, oftentimes being 10. This transformation ultimately emphasizes changes that might be too small to recognize without the implementation of a logarhythm. A bad thing about logarhythmic transformation is that they are sometimes hard to read, possibly becoming confusing to the reader and complicating the understanding of overall change. In addition to the zero-based index and logarhythmic transformations, moving average is also a good tool for revealing change in a data visualization. A moving average is a series of averages of multiple subsets of data. A good thing about a moving average is that it provides an average that fluctuates to better represent the data in the visualization. A bad thing about moving averages is that they don't correlate well to the general trend of the data. This means that the moving average only correlates well to small subsets of data, which don't reveal the overall trend of the entire data set. Revealing change in data sets can be accomplished by maniuplating the data to better represent its characteristics and show overall trends within the data set.
